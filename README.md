## Regression Models using Deep Learning to predict Phosphorus Concentration based on Time and Location

#### Purpose
In this blog post, I’ll build and compare two deep learning models that predict phosphorus concentration in Chesapeake Bay tidal regions based on the time and location of sample.

#### Data
Yearly water quality data on the Chesapeake Bay’s tidal and non-tidal regions going back to 1984 is publicly available on the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) DataHub ([Chesapeake Bay Program DataHub](https://datahub.chesapeakebay.net/FileDownloads), n.d.).

For my analysis, I will be using 2010 to 2019 data collected at 143 different monitoring stations positioned throughout the Chesapeake Bay tidal regions, which includes the mainstem Bay and tributary components. Across the 10 years that we are looking at, we’ll have a total of 43,590 phosphorus observations.
